# Whack-A-Mole-By-Hayat

# Description:
Whack-a-Mole is a classic arcade game brought to life in the digital realm. The objective of the game is simple yet entertaining: players must swiftly "whack" the virtual moles that randomly pop up from different holes on the screen. The player's score increases with each successful whack, creating a fast-paced and engaging experience. The game has a time limit of 20 seconds, challenging players to achieve the highest score possible within the given timeframe. The interface features a vibrant design with a mole popping up from one of nine holes at random intervals. Quick reflexes and precision are key to maximizing one's score in this nostalgic and enjoyable Whack-a-Mole game.

In the development of this Whack-a-Mole game, a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was employed to create the interactive experience. The JavaScript code utilizes functions like `randomTime` and `randomHole` to control the appearance of moles at varying intervals and locations. The `peep` function handles the dynamic display of moles, ensuring they emerge and retreat within the specified time frame. The game's core logic, including score tracking and event handling for mole whacking, is encapsulated in well-defined functions. Additionally, the use of `setTimeout` and event listeners enhances the game's responsiveness and interactivity. While the provided code doesn't explicitly contain pseudocode, it showcases how developers can structure and implement game mechanics, making it an insightful example for those interested in understanding the foundations of game development.
